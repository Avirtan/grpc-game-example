tshooter - a local or multiplayer terminal game.

Created by Samuel Mortenson.

The included binaries are:

- tshooter_*_client_local
    Play against bots on your local machine. Pass the -bots flag to change the
    number of bots you play with.
- tshooter_*_server
    Run a multiplayer server. Pass -bots to change the number of bots, -port to
    change the port (defaults to 8888), and -password to set a password.
- tshooter_*_client
    Connect to a multiplayer game. A UI will let you enter server information.

You can run these by opening your favorite terminal and executing them.

If you're not sure how to open a terminal, try using the "launcher" versions of
the binaries - this should open the correct terminal based on your operating
system.

Note that on Windows, cmd.exe is quite slow, so you may want to try out an
alternative terminal emulator with a higher refresh/draw rate.
